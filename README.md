#### desire

i desire  
your dark skin  
and warm chest

you desire  
my loyalty  
but, i am foul at best

we desire  
the heat of sex  
that atomic fusion of togetherness

#### believe saint eve

she lies not  
except with legs apart

she leads men to sin  
and too to chart the stars

she offers wisdom  
in the form of a plump cherry tart

#### sweeter than

sweeter than wine  
is a kiss with intent,  
sweeter than cherries  
is the touch that demands  
one to repent,  
sweeter than summer grapes  
is the heat of the tongue  
upon bone tooth  
that tickles life's breath

#### wear the crown

heavy is the mind  
that is forged to rule

for it must conquer the soul  
and crafty heart too

to adorn the diadem  
you must indeed be one of them

that seat on the table of fate  
and breathe ether

no debate

#### alone on high

a single red tree  
on a mountain alone  
amongst many greens  
far from home

yet never does sing  
her roots do run deep  
way past the earth's soul

#### lift my eyes

and avoid all evil

i seek out not  
that which will kill  
my fragile soul  
my subtle heart

kings do not keep dogs

#### rustic chant

favour on my head  
blessings on my hands  
increase in my life  
speed upon my feet

i shall not know defeat  
goodness is mine - and not strife

wealth must cover my bed

to the new year  
to a restart of the illusional clock

to a piece of a time  
raw and unknown

we bow before no throne

## break your evil

cease from deceit  
your darkened soul  
rinse and repeat

as a dog to its vomit  
so is a fool to folly

from unwonted sin

your own shadow, defeat

## love, means not a thing

#### ripples

let me float away  
like the butterfly  
of time

my love burns today  
like a  
bunch of summer grapes

fall flat of decisive

#### berserker

i am too calm a poet  
to be enlivened by  
shallow longing

wears in truth  
the mask of indecision

#### when souls weep

does it seem, like i complain  
about love's pain  
too often

#### all black

i am an  
all dark hurt darling  
poet, artist, coder

with all the shades  
of my many rainbows  
i still find no sun  
to kiss my dew with its rays

yet the blanched and undeserving  
find love enough, to cheat upon

#### romeo

she was numb  
to my touch

my caress  
made her uncomfortable  
triggered no sort of joy

i felt then coy  
while acting the fool

[@POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)  
&copy; Téy

---

#### the way of fire

i feel less  
than nothing indeed

just a craving

an instinctive hunger  
a need  
to pour out love

and scatter my seed

#### acupuncture

needles might release  
my pent-up energy

my epidermis is cold  
dead to all relief

all i know now is grief  
and too, that for my emptiness  
there is no honest need

#### basic sh\*t

love is not a spark  
not a flower  
not a pure emotion

it is a tool for survival

just some basic shyt

somebody, anyone  
ask not, when i smile no more  
i now look without

the world moves on cold  
blind to my inner turmoil  
i need love: please give
